# React Native demo ToDo app
This is a demo To Do project built with React Native for demo and for fun.

The project consist of just a main screen (no navigation) and a simple user interface. 
Although a complete overkill for this simple project, redux was used for handling state as it is probably the most used combination when developing with RN, and also, redux-toolkit removes some of the needed boilterplate.

### Steps for running the project:
1) clone this repo
2) `cd rn-todo` to move into the project folder
3) run `npm install`
4) (iOS only) `cd ios`
5) (iOS only) `pod install`
6) (iOS only) `cd ..` back into the root folder
7) `npm run ios` or `npm run android`

### Steps for testing
1) Just run `npm test`
